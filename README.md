# Skills
Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that an Agent loads dynamically to improve performance on specialized tasks. Skills teach Claude how to complete specific tasks in a repeatable way, whether that's creating documents with your company's brand guidelines, analyzing data using your organization's specific workflows, or automating personal tasks.

# About This Repository

This repository contains skills. Skills might range from creative applications (art, music, design) to technical tasks (testing web apps, MCP server generation) to enterprise workflows (communications, branding, etc.).

Each skill is self-contained in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing the instructions and metadata that Claude uses. Browse through these skills to get inspiration for your own skills or to understand different patterns and approaches.

## Disclaimer

Always test skills thoroughly in your own environment before relying on them for critical tasks.
